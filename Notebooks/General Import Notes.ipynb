    "    - Note: For PyCap, duplicates in the unique key will be automatically dropped during import (the first occurence of the duplicate will be uploaded) without any warning or error message prompt. Need to see if this is the case for REDCapR\n",
    "2. That if `redcap_repeat_instrument` is part of the unique key that its values are valid and associated with the correct event. <br>\n",
    "3. Exception for longitudinal projects with repeating events and no repeating instruments: Data exported form these projects will have the 'redcap_repeat_instrument' column with all values set to NA. This column is technically not needed in this type of project and API import will be accepted with (as long as all values are NA) or without it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure** <br>\n",
    "1. That non-missing fields are in the correct instrument/event row (for longitudinal projects or projects with repeating instruments).\n",

    "2. Text Fields\n",
    "    - That numeric values only are present in numeric validation fields. <br>\n",
    "    - That integer values only are present in integer validation fields. <br>\n",
    "    - That date and datetime fields are in the YMD format (not sure about time fields?) (can be Y/M/D or Y-M-D). <br>\n",
    "    - That email fields have an 'something' + @ + 'something' + . + 'something' (does not check for valid domain names; multiple '.somethings' are accepted after @ symbol (e.g., @doh.wa.gov)). <br>\n",
    "    - That phone numbers have 10 digits and that the area code starts with digits 2-9 (can have ###-###-#### format or just ##########). <br>\n",
